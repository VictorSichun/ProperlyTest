## Report
First of all, apologize to the late submission because of a miscalculation of the time, plus some overly complex methods implemented. But still I've learned a lot from those mistakes.:)
### Languages
I used mostly pure Html/CSS/JavaScript to establish the application. Because JavaScript is the one of languages I'm familiar with the most and it is easy to implement visualization along with Html/CSS.
### About the tasks
The thoughts of the tasks were pretty simple:
1. Read through README.md file and had a picture of how the application will be looked like in my mind;
2. Fully understood the requirements of each task and started coding;
3. Did simple tests after each small step and thought the business logic behind the scene critically;
4. Learned a lot from each material I've gone through during the development;
### Problems
1. Querying to dataset without any SQL was really a pain. So I've tried to establish a database for the given json files, but I failed to load the database with pure JavaScript;
2. Querying multiple asynchronous HttpRequests without paying money was really a pain as well. I implemented reverse geocoding supported by google api for the first task, but everyday there are limited queries available, which would make the application run into fail;
### Summary
It's my pleasure to take this code chanllenge. No matter I would be selected or not, I've learned a lot, many thanks!
